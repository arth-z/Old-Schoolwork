"Jester's Revenge"

A small grid-based bullet-hell-esque game made in the Java Greenfoot engine, originally as a school project. 
Boss rush/arcade format, with scoring. Four bosses. See documentation for credits on in-game assets.
Go to a specific tile to attack the enemies, and stay out of the tiles that will damage you. When your health reaches 0, you die. When boss health reaches 0, they die, and you move on to the next one until you win the game.
