Everything *should* work per assignment specifications? I got the bonus too. Again, I don't think much of what I did was *that* complicated, so the code is mostly 'what you see is what you get'. Most of the work for the new functions has been done in AudioContentStore and MyAudioUI, mostly just iteration+downloading and new list methods. Error handling in MyAudioUI could likely be streamlined a bit, joining together several blocks instead of having many different try/catch blocks but some of the try/catch blocks are useful for smaller more specific things. Custom exceptions are...okay, I think, they cover the same-ish amount of cases as the old error messages.

Oh yeah, I generally only put my name and student ID at the top of the files I actually changed - for the rest, they're straight from the sample solution as-is.
